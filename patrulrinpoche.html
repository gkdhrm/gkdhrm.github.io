            { text: "Perfectly stay in the natural flow; there is no other concentration. Perfectly realize the natural state; there is no other wisdom. The essence of meditation is to rest in the uncontrived state, free from effort and fabrication. When you abide in this way, all phenomena are seen as the play of awareness, and you are no longer caught by attachment or aversion.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "In meditation which is a continuous flow of staying in the state at all times and in every circumstance, there is neither suppression nor production of dwelling and proliferation. If there is dwelling, that is the dharmakaya's own face, and if there is proliferation, that is preserved as the self-liveliness of wisdom. Whatever comes from mind's liveliness as discursive thoughts, be it anger, attachment, happiness, or sadness, if the nature of the discursive thoughts is known as dharmata, they become the shifting events of the dharmakaya.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "Additionally, whatever discursive thought or affliction arises, it is not something apart from dharmakaya wisdom. Rather, the nature of those discursive thoughts is actual dharmakaya, the ground's luminosity. If that, which is called 'the mother luminosity resident in the ground', is recognized, there is self-recognition of the view of self-knowing luminosity previously introduced by the guru. Abiding in one's own face of the two luminosities of ground and path become inseparable is called 'the meeting of mother and son luminosities.'", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "Just calling one's practice 'approach and accomplishment' and staying in retreat for years will produce nothing but hardship. Completing hundreds of millions of mantras will not even bring the warmth of the ordinary qualities that mark one's progress on the path. If the essential points of the path are not taken into account, perseverance will amount to nothing more than chasing a mirage. The heart of the path is direct recognition of the nature of mind.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "What makes an action positive or negative? Not how it looks, not whether it is big or small, but the positive or negative motivation that is behind it. No matter how many teachings you have heard, to be motivated by ordinary concerns, such as a desire for greatness, fame, or whatever, is not the way of the true Dharma. The true path is to act with pure intention, free from attachment and aversion.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "The essence of Dzogchen is to recognize the nature of mind and rest in that recognition without distraction. It is not about achieving a special state or suppressing thoughts, but about seeing the true nature of all phenomena as the play of awareness. When you rest in this recognition, all confusion dissolves, and you abide in the natural state, free from suffering.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "In the practice of Dzogchen, there is no need to reject thoughts or emotions. They are the self-display of awareness, like waves on the ocean. When you recognize their nature, they self-liberate without effort, and you remain undisturbed in the natural state. This is the heart of nondual realization.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "The natural state is beyond meditation and non-meditation, beyond effort and non-effort. It is the spontaneous presence of awareness, free from all contrivance. When you rest in this state, you are free from all striving, and the mind's true nature reveals itself effortlessly.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "The true nature of mind is like space: open, boundless, and unobstructed. All phenomena arise and dissolve within this space, leaving no trace. When you recognize this, you are free from all limitations, and you abide in the great peace of Dzogchen.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "The practice of nonmeditation is to remain in the natural state without effort or fabrication. It's not about trying to stop thoughts or create a special experience. It's about allowing everything to be as it is, without interference or manipulation. In this way, all phenomena self-liberate in the expanse of awareness.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "The mind's true nature is beyond birth and death, beyond coming and going. It is the ground of all experience, the source of all appearances. When you recognize this, you are free from hope and fear, free from striving and struggle. Abide in the natural state, and you will discover the great peace that is the heart of Dzogchen.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "All phenomena are the display of awareness, like reflections in a mirror. They have no independent existence, no true substance. When you see this, you are no longer caught by attachment or aversion. You rest in the spaciousness of your own nature, free from all limitations.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "The path of Dzogchen is not about effort or achievement. It is about recognizing what is already present, what has always been present. The teacher's role is to introduce you to your own nature, and your role is to recognize and remain in that state. This is the essence of all the teachings.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "Do not seek outside yourself for realization. The true nature of mind is not found in books, rituals, or philosophies. It is found in the direct experience of awareness, here and now. Trust in your own recognition, and you will find the freedom that cannot be lost.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "When you rest in the natural state, all thoughts and emotions arise and dissolve like clouds in the sky. The sky is never affected by the clouds, no matter how many appear. In the same way, your true nature is never affected by the play of thoughts and emotions. Recognize this, and you are free.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "The three statements that strike the vital point are the heart of Dzogchen. First, recognize your own nature. Second, remain in that recognition with unwavering certainty. Third, have confidence that all phenomena self-liberate in the expanse of awareness. These three are the complete path to liberation.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "Awareness is self-knowing, self-luminous, and free from all limitations. It is not created by causes or conditions, nor is it destroyed by time or change. When you recognize this, you are no longer bound by the dualities of samsara and nirvana. You abide in the great equality of all phenomena.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "The natural state is beyond words and concepts, beyond all descriptions. It cannot be grasped by the intellect, nor can it be lost or destroyed. Rest in the uncontrived simplicity of awareness, and you will discover the freedom that is your true nature.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "All teachings are methods to bring you to the recognition of your own nature. Once you have recognized, there is nothing more to seek, nothing more to do. Remain in the natural state, and all phenomena will self-liberate without effort.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" },
            { text: "The mind's true nature is like space: open, boundless, and unobstructed. All phenomena arise and dissolve within this space, leaving no trace. When you recognize this, you are free from all limitations, and you abide in the great peace of Dzogchen.", author: "Patrul Rinpoche" }
