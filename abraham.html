When you feel poor, you attract more poverty. When you feel sick, you attract more sickness. When you feel unworthy, you attract more unworthiness. When you feel happy, you attract more happiness. You can change your life by changing the way you feel.",

Your attention to things that you consider to be wrong, or not enough, or unwanted, is what keeps you from allowing what you want to come into your experience. What you think and what you feel and what manifests is always a match â€” no exceptions.",

But, if you don't feel good, right now, in the absence of it, it is not likely to come. Feeling good is the most important thing. Joy is really where you are wanting to put your emphasis. Joy in the now is really the most important thing.",

The solution is a different frequency than the problem. The solution is here. Every time you look at the problem, you're tuning your tuner to the problem frequency. Turn your tuner to the solution frequency, and the solution welcomes you in with open arms. Everything that you want is active in your vibrational reality. Everything you want is pulsing and alive and calling you toward it. All you have to do is chill.",

It just receives the vibration and answers it with things that match it. This is how you create your own reality. It's why you must be aware of your thoughts and focus on feeling good, because what you think and feel is always reflected back to you through the Law of Attraction.",

But your lack of appreciation for yourself, and your personal perception of unworthiness, holds you apart from that. Let it in. Let it in. Let it in. You are worthy. You are valued. You are the object of appreciation of Source. If you will accept those feelings of appreciation, and no longer try to hold yourself apart from them, your valve will open, and the true essence of that which is you will reveal itself to you in all moments.",

It's not when you get the better job. Your life is right now. It will always be right now. You might as well decide to start enjoying your life right now, because it's not ever going to get better than right now-until it gets better right now!",

The capacity to love and laugh, that's when you're really living. That's when you're really succeeding as a human. Your natural state is joy. Your natural state is love. Your natural state is connection to Source Energy. So when you have found vibrational alignment with that, you are tuned in, tapped in, turned on. And that is the measure of your success.",

Your job is to simply align with the good. When you focus upon anything, you activate a vibration within you. The Law of Attraction then matches that vibration. This is the key to creating the life you want. Focus on the essence of what you want, not the specifics. Trust that the Universe knows the perfect timing and path for your desires to manifest.",

If you focus on what you want, your life will be filled with it. Focusing on unwanted things only brings more of the same into your life experience. The Universe doesn't hear your words, it feels your vibration. So focus on feeling good, and watch as the good things in your life multiply.",

From this place, you have access to infinite intelligence, creativity, and love. Your positive energy ripples out and affects everyone around you. By focusing on your own happiness and well-being, you become a powerful force for good in the world. Remember, you cannot get poor enough to help poor people thrive or sick enough to help sick people get well. Your job is to be as happy as you can be, and in doing so, you will be an uplifter to all who cross your path.",

Well-being is the order of this Universe. Well-being is the basis of this Universe. Well-being is what is. Sometimes you have to get out of the way of it and let it in. Lighten up. When you try too hard, when you struggle too much, when you make it too serious, you sometimes hold yourself apart from what you want.",

Energy-frolicking and eager. That's who you are. And so, if you're always reaching for alignment with that, you're always on your path, and your path will take you into all kinds of places. We will not deny that you will not discover miracles and create the reality that you consider your ideal. All of that is there for you. But we can't take our eyes off of you long enough to look down the road to see where you're going. We can't take our eyes off of you.",

In your joy you will grow; in your growth you will add to the expansion of All-That-Is. (You can't get it wrong, and you never get it done.) Every part of your life is infinitely expanding.

Expectation is a powerful attractive force. Expect the things you want, and don't expect the things you don't want.",

You're always looking for the best in yourself. And out of that, you would be inspired to thoughts and words and actions that would always serve you.",

When you get your thoughts and emotions in alignment with the energy of your desire, you will see evidence of that evidence. And as you see that evidence and acknowledge that evidence, the evidence will expand. And as you expand it and expect it and relax into it and appreciate it, it will expand more. And then you will be surrounded by so much evidence that there will be no question about the power you have to create your own reality.",

For you are the creator of your own experienceâ€”you have only to decide it and allow it to be.",

So, when you're feeling insecure, you're offering a vibration of insecurity. When you're feeling vulnerable, you're offering a vibration of vulnerability. When you're feeling strong, you're offering a vibration of strength. The Law of Attraction is responding to the way you feel.",

That's the way it works. You have to change the way you feel. Now how do you do that? You do it by softening your resistance to unwanted things. You do it by looking for positive aspects. You do it by looking for things to appreciate. You do it by practicing good-feeling thoughts. And as you do that more and more, you will find yourself in the place where good things just keep flowing to you.",

Your work is to create the feeling in yourself, and when you do, the thing must come. It is Law. It must come. And so you can create it first, vibrationally, and then the circumstances and events line up to match the vibration. That's why you want to do the Rampage of Appreciation. That's why you want to do Virtual Reality. That's why you want to imagine it the way you want it to be. That's why you want to pretend.",
