Separate them from the situation, which is always neutral, which always is as it is. There is the situation or the fact, and here are my thoughts about it. Instead of making up stories, stay with the facts.",

Because this is the experience you are having at the moment. The present moment is always perfect, even if the mind denies it and creates suffering.",

Whereas before you dwelt in time and paid brief visits to the Now, have your dwelling place in the Now and pay brief visits to past and future when required to deal with the practical aspects of your life situation.",

                text: "Acknowledging the good that you already have in your life is the foundation for all abundance. Abundance does not come from getting more of what you already have, but from acknowledging and appreciating what you have while wanting more. This is the abundance paradox: the more you acknowledge what you have, the more you will attract.",

This is not to say you will like everyone, or agree with them, or approve of their actions and opinions. Sometimes the power of presence can only be realized through accepting what is, including people's unconsciousness and limitations.",

Another factor has come in, something that is not of the mind: the witnessing presence. The present moment holds the key to liberation. But you cannot find the present moment as long as you are your mind.",

Make becoming conscious of what you are doing as you are doing it, your practice. Even the smallest task can be transformed if done with complete attention. The rewards are immeasurable.",

                text: "All true artists, whether they know it or not, create from a place of no-mind, from inner stillness. The mind then gives form to the creative impulse or insight. Even the great scientists have reported that their creative breakthroughs came at a time of mental quietude. The surprising result of a survey among America's most eminent mathematicians was that thinking 'plays only a subordinate part in the brief, decisive phase of the creative act itself.'",

When you live in surrender, something comes through you into the world of duality that is not of this world. It shines through your thoughts, feelings, and actions, yet it is greater than all of these.",

Concealed within it remains a deep-seated sense of dissatisfaction, of incompleteness, of 'not enough.' This gives rise to the ego's ceaseless wanting, its continuous demand for more, for what it thinks is 'needed' for its fulfillment and completion.",
