It's seeing through the facade of pretense. It's the complete eradication of everything we imagined to be true.

When it is authentic, there is no one to claim it. Enlightenment is very ordinary; it is nothing special. Rather than making you more special, it is going to make you less special. It plants you right in the center of a wonderful humility and innocence.",

When you get out of the driver's seat, it can drive itself so much easierâ€”it can flow in ways you never imagined. Life becomes almost magical. The illusion of the 'me' is no longer in the way.

That was silly, I should have just skipped over that stage.' The sense of separate self is ultimately illusory but actually quite a natural stage of development. Moving beyond the separate self is a death of an identity, and in that death, true freedom is found.",

This shift is life-transforming, as it changes our entire worldview and the way we relate to life.",

Part of allowing the whole world to wake up is recognizing that the whole world is freeâ€”everybody is free to be as they are. Until you have given the whole world its freedom, you'll never have your freedom. True freedom is the recognition that everyone is free to agree or disagree, to love or hate, to see things as you see them or differently.",

When I have a thought about you, that's something I've created. I've turned you into an idea. In a certain sense, if I have an idea about you that I believe, I've degraded you.

When you stop resisting, you see that what seems frightening is actually the absolute beauty of reality. When you see that everything is a momentary display of reality, then you stop resisting it. Resistance hurts, only every single time. Love is the state of nonresistance.",

The will is one of those things that's hard to understand clearly until it's no longer really there.",

In this gap of not knowing, in the suspension of any conclusion, a whole other element of life and reality can rush in. This is what I call grace. It's that moment of 'ah-ha!'â€”a moment of recognition when we realize something that previously we never could quite imagine.",

A lot of spirituality is often trying to dismantle our attachment to that psychological self. The question isn't meant so you can find a new answer, a new better version of youâ€”it's to disassemble the version that you have made up.",

You move from a mind-based or ego-based identification to an identity that's more based in our fundamental nature. It's very life-transforming because then you're looking at life from an awareness point-of-view rather than a mind-based point-of-view.",
