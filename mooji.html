Remain as the witness, the pure presence that is untouched by any event. In this seeing, you discover a peace that cannot be disturbed, a joy that is not dependent on circumstances. This is your true nature, ever-present and unchanging.",

But you are already complete, already whole, lacking nothing. The sense of lack is only a thought, a passing cloud in the vast sky of your being. Recognize this and rest in your natural state of completeness. All striving then falls away, and you abide in effortless peace.",

Freedom is not something to be attained; it is your very essence.",

See through this illusion, and suffering dissolves in the light of your true nature.",

In this way, you live in harmony with yourself and the world.",

This is the peace that passes all understanding.",

Surrender is not weakness; it is the highest strength.",

See through the illusion of the ego, and you will find that there is only awareness, pure and free. The ego cannot survive the light of true understanding. Let it dissolve, and be free.",

This love is not personal; it embraces all beings without exception. In the light of this love, all differences dissolve, and only oneness remains.",
