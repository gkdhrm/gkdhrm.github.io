This is because your state of being is a frequency that you broadcast to the universe, and the universe responds by matching that frequency with experiences that resonate with it. To manifest a new reality, you must become the person who already has what you want. Feel the emotions of having your desire fulfilled, embody the energy of that version of yourself, and watch as your external reality begins to shift to match your internal state.",

Engage all your senses: see it, hear it, feel it, taste it, smell it. As you do this, allow the emotions of having that experience to wash over you. Feel the joy, excitement, gratitude, or peace that comes with it. Practice this daily, and soon you'll find that your default state of being begins to shift. Remember, the more you can sustain this elevated emotional state, the more you draw that reality to you.",

As you release old patterns held in the body, you create space for new, empowering states of being to take root. Pay attention to your body's signals and work on aligning your physical state with your desired emotional and mental state.",

This state of being attracts more experiences to be grateful for. Practice gratitude daily by focusing on what you appreciate in your life right now. Then, extend that gratitude to things you want as if you already have them. Feel the emotion of gratitude deeply. This practice will shift your state of being to one of abundance and receptivity, drawing more positive experiences into your reality.",

To achieve this state, practice heart-focused breathing. Focus your attention on your heart area and imagine breathing through your heart. As you do this, cultivate feelings of appreciation or love.

Before sleep and upon waking, when your subconscious is most receptive, spend time affirming your new beliefs, visualizing your desired reality, and feeling the associated emotions.
