The sense of 'I am' is the doorway to your true nature. Remain with the sense of being, and all illusions will dissolve. In this recognition, you are free from all suffering.", author: "Nisargadatta Maharaj" },
            { text: "The mind creates the world and fills it with objects and events. But you are not the mind; you are the witness of the mind. When you see this clearly, you are no longer bound by the mind's projections. You rest in your natural state, untouched by the play of phenomena.", author: "Nisargadatta Maharaj" },
            { text: "All you need to do is to find the source of the 'I am' sense and abide there. Do not be distracted by thoughts, sensations, or experiences. The source is pure awareness, ever-present and unchanging. In this awareness, all questions are answered, and all doubts dissolve.", author: "Nisargadatta Maharaj" },
            { text: "You are not what you take yourself to be. The body and mind are only instruments, not your true self. Your real nature is beyond all concepts, beyond birth and death. Realize this, and you are free from all fear and desire.", author: "Nisargadatta Maharaj" },
            { text: "The world is a projection of the mind, a play of consciousness. When you know yourself as the witness, the world loses its power to bind you. You remain as the unchanging awareness, at peace in the midst of all change.", author: "Nisargadatta Maharaj" },
            { text: "Suffering arises from identification with the body and mind. When you see that you are not these, suffering ends. You are the formless, changeless reality in which all forms appear. This is the highest knowledge, the end of all seeking.", author: "Nisargadatta Maharaj" },
            { text: "Do not try to change the world; change your understanding of yourself. When you know yourself as pure awareness, the world is seen as a play, a passing show. You are the screen on which all appears, untouched by the drama of life.", author: "Nisargadatta Maharaj" },
            { text: "The sense of individuality is only a habit of thought. In truth, there is only one consciousness, appearing as many. When you see this, all separation ends, and you rest in the peace of oneness.", author: "Nisargadatta Maharaj" },
            { text: "The mind is restless, always seeking, always dissatisfied. But you are not the mind; you are the awareness in which the mind appears. Rest in this awareness, and all restlessness will cease.", author: "Nisargadatta Maharaj" },
            { text: "You do not need to become anything; you only need to recognize what you already are. The search for enlightenment is itself a distraction. Be still, and know that you are the Self, pure and free.", author: "Nisargadatta Maharaj" },

            { text: "You are not the doer; all actions happen spontaneously in consciousness. When you see this, all anxiety and worry disappear. You rest in the peace of non-doership, free from all burden.", author: "Nisargadatta Maharaj" },

            { text: "You are the light of awareness, shining in every experience. Do not look for yourself in the objects of perception; you are the perceiver, the witness of all that appears. This recognition is the key to lasting peace and happiness.", author: "Nisargadatta Maharaj" },
            { text: "Freedom is not the absence of limitation, but the recognition that you are not limited by anything. You are the boundless awareness in which all limitations appear and disappear. This is the true meaning of liberation.", author: "Nisargadatta Maharaj" },
            { text: "Let thoughts come and go, like clouds in the sky. You are the sky, vast and unchanging, untouched by the passing weather. In this recognition, all anxiety and fear dissolve.", author: "Nisargadatta Maharaj" },
            { text: "The greatest gift you can offer the world is your own presence. When you are fully present, you radiate peace and love to all around you. This is the true service, the highest form of compassion.", author: "Nisargadatta Maharaj" },
            { text: "Peace is not something to be attained, but the natural state of being. When you stop searching and simply rest in awareness, peace reveals itself. It is always present, waiting to be recognized.", author: "Nisargadatta Maharaj" }
