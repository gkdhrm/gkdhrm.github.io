It is the ever-present background of all experience, never coming or going, never changing. All that changes is the content of experience, but the knowing of experience‚Äîawareness itself‚Äîremains untouched.",

It is the very nature of our being, always present beneath the surface of the mind's activity. When the mind's agitation subsides, happiness shines by itself, effortlessly. This happiness is not dependent on circumstances, but is the background of all experience.",

When we recognize our true nature as open, unlimited awareness, the sense of separation dissolves. What remains is peace, love, and the natural ease of being.",

There is nothing outside of awareness, just as there is nothing outside the screen in a movie. The world, the body, and the mind are appearances within the field of knowing. Our essential nature is this knowing presence, not any particular experience that arises within it.",

The ocean is never disturbed by its waves, nor is awareness disturbed by the content of experience. Rest as the ocean of awareness, allowing all things to come and go without resistance.",

The end of suffering is the acceptance of the present moment as it is, and the recognition that our true nature is already whole and complete. Nothing needs to be added or taken away. Peace is the natural state of being.",

It is the recognition that we are already the awareness in which all experience arises. There is nothing to achieve, nowhere to go, nothing to become. Simply be as you are, and let everything else be as it is.",

When it claims to be the center of experience, it creates confusion and suffering. Let the mind rest in the heart of awareness, and all becomes clear.",
