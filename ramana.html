In this stillness, all doubts and suffering vanish. The Self alone remains, shining in its own light.", author: "Ramana Maharshi" },

We think that there is something hiding our Reality, and that it must be destroyed before the Reality is gained. It is ridiculous. A day will dawn when you will laugh at all your past efforts. That which will be on the day you laugh is also here and now.", author: "Ramana Maharshi" },
